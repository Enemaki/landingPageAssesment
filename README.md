## Landing Page with Account Management (React, Vite)

This project is a landing page application built with React and Vite that showcases a user login and account creation flow. It demonstrates a basic user interface.

### Features

  * Create Account: Users can easily register for an account with necessary information.
  * Login: Existing users can log in to access restricted areas of the application (optional, based on future implementation).
  * Responsive Design: The landing page adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on any device.

Note: This project focuses on creating the basic structure of the landing page and user account management. Functionality like email verification, password reset, and integration with a backend authentication system can be implemented in future iterations.

### Technologies Used

  * **Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript
  * Framework: Vite React ([vitejs.dev](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.google.com/url?sa=E%26source=gmail%26q=https://vitejs.dev/))

### Understanding the Code

Explore the project code to see how different components work together:

  * AccountForm component: Handles user input for creating or logging into an account.
  * Form validation: (Optional) Implement basic validation to ensure users enter valid information.

Note: Authentication functionality is currently not integrated with a backend. Future development can involve connecting with an API for real user login and registration.
